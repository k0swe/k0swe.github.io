    <p>I’ve been switching my focus more to the software engineering side of the hobby. I’ve been getting
more and more involved in <a href="https://github.com/la5nta/pat">Pat</a> and have been particularly interested
in the form templates features, which has been available as a beta feature for about a year now. I
can’t take credit for most of the form templates code, most of that was written by Rainer
Grosskopf <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KI7RMJ</code>, but I was able to nudge Pat’s founder, Martin Pedersen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LA5NTA</code>, into creating a
new release.</p>

<p>So far, most of the feedback is very positive! There are a couple of bugs to fix and necessary UX
improvements to make, but at least it’s out there in the world!</p>
