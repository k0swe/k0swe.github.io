&lt;p&gt;I’m intrigued by software-defined radios, which are the cutting edge in radio technology and have a
much wider operating range than their discrete component cousins. When I saw that one popular model
was $20, I picked one up on a whim without really knowing what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had purchased an &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.com/B011HVUEME&quot;&gt;RTL-SDR Blog V3 kit&lt;/a&gt;. I was just a tad disappointed
to learn it’s a receive-only SDR, but for the price, I wasn’t expecting perfection. I found a couple
of YouTube &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9QzklSyKqQM&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; to give me some ideas for things to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I run Linux primarily, I found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://gqrx.dk/download/install-ubuntu&quot;&gt;Gqrx&lt;/a&gt;
was a good starting point. It wasn’t too difficult to get installed and running. This is my first
experience with waterfall displays and being able to quickly tune around. It’s fun looking at
broadcast FM stations to see which ones have digital sidebands, or scrolling around in the ham bands
to find transmissions like little caterpillars running down the screen. I can definitely see where
this will be a nice tool in my ham radio toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">PiPat</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2019/07/14/pipat.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PiPat" /><published>2019-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2019/07/14/pipat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2019/07/14/pipat.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mn9mlZGJo6M/XXQfNEIJoJI/AAAAAAABp3M/x-QlGJSUH6Ap8rp23cqGLV9srcE7a1FzgCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190806_160827%2B%25281%2529.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PiPat set up in a car&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking forward to using &lt;a href=&quot;http://pigate.net/&quot;&gt;PiGate&lt;/a&gt; on my TNC-Pi rig as a Winlink
client, but the pre-built disk images don’t work with my hardware (Raspberry Pi 3B+). The
integrator/maintainer of PiGate, Mark Griffith &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KD0QYN&lt;/code&gt;, told me that building a new image is
getting harder because Raspbian has moved to PHP7, and SquirrelMail is incompatible and is not
likely to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I set about setting up something similar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpat.io/&quot;&gt;Pat&lt;/a&gt;
and setting up the Pi in Wi-Fi AP mode. There are only a couple of Winlink RMSs on VHF in my area,
and none that I can reach from my house on my current equipment, so I’ve been driving to a nearby
hill with good line-of-sight. I can power the Pi with a USB battery, connect my phone or laptop to
the Wi-Fi AP, and go to town with the Pat web application! I call it

&lt;p&gt;I purchased a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tnc-x.com/TNCPi.htm&quot;&gt;TNC-Pi 2&lt;/a&gt; from Coastal Chipworks (John Hansen, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;W2FS&lt;/code&gt;).
It took longer than I’d like to admit to assemble, but I did get it working. So far I’ve gotten
&lt;a href=&quot;https://xastir.org/index.php/Main_Page&quot;&gt;XASTIR&lt;/a&gt; for APRS working (had to build from source), and
been able to view local RF station reports, view APRS-IS data and even published RF messages to the
internet as an IGate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I continue playing with APRS, I’ll probably look at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ka2ddo.org/ka2ddo/YAAC.html&quot;&gt;YAAC&lt;/a&gt;. XASTIR works and is full-featured and mature, but
that UI is showing its age. I’d also like a headless IGate option, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aprs-is.net/javAPRSSrvr/&quot;&gt;javAPRSSrvr&lt;/a&gt;
sounds like a solid option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d still like to play around with Winlink and PiGate, and see that the TNC’s transmit is working
along with receive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dirty 30</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2019/06/01/dirty30.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dirty 30" /><published>2019-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2019/06/01/dirty30</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2019/06/01/dirty30.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aDcFNfTcZcs/XXQdNwNgbzI/AAAAAAABp2w/rOlHaLaLuCUTgByACtZ_z4wIcALb1EmlgCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190601_120214.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shielding a laptop from the rain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined about 40 hams from Colorado AuxComm, several ARES districts and the Rocky Mountain Ham
Radio group to provide race communications for the Dirty 30, a 30 mile/50 km ultra trail run through
Golden Gate Canyon State Park. Our mission is to make sure that every runner that steps on the
mountainous, dispersed course also steps off at the end of the day, and by all accounts, 2019 was a
very good year for the comms team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aid station (#3, Horseshoe Trailhead) started the day with no RFID mat to automatically read
bibs, so I spent the morning manually entering bib numbers into my laptop, connected via Wi-Fi and
microwave back to the comm trailer running the centralized race web server.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Vanity Callsign Came In</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2019/05/12/vanity.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vanity Callsign Came In" /><published>2019-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2019/05/12/vanity</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2019/05/12/vanity.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.gq.com/photos/599edbab065b7f266534b9b1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/How-To-Be-Vain-Art-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How To Be Vain A Modern Man's Grooming Guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My amateur callsign is now &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;K0SWE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people use their initials, but combinations of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;K0&lt;/code&gt; and my initials end up with rather
unfortunate connotations. Instead, I chose something with my job title, “software engineer,” which
at my workplace is abbreviated as SWE.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TYT MD-380</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/26/tyt.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TYT MD-380" /><published>2019-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/26/tyt</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/26/tyt.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0011/7220/9721/products/28-020-389_01_13e03b44-1144-4b17-814e-b8044a9026cd.JPG?v=1550113464&quot; alt=&quot;TYT MD-380&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working analog FM, I’ve heard several folks mention digital modes. There are a couple of
competing standards, but it sounds like locally in the Denver area, DMR is the most popular. In
light of that, I picked up a TYT MD-380 dual-band DMR handheld. It’s certainly nice to have
something more sophisticated than the Baofeng I’ve been using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it uses the same Kenwood K1 style plug, so headsets and hand mics will be compatible
between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Got My Ticket</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/16/ticket.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Got My Ticket" /><published>2019-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/16/ticket</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/16/ticket.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/golden_ticket.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Golden ticket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My amateur radio license has been assigned! For now, I’m KE0VJM. I’ve been listening to the bands a
bit on a Baofeng UV-5R. I’ve heard some negative reviews about their effects on the ham bands, so I
probably won’t stick with it for long, but at $20 you can’t beat the price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I passed my general-class exam, I’m eligible for a shorter vanity callsign, so I might apply
for that soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Took my Test</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/06/test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Took my Test" /><published>2019-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/06/test</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2019/04/06/test.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bubble_test.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Multiple choice test&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks of studying for the amateur radio technician-level exam and cramming
last-minute for the general-level, I took my test today at the annual Longmont Amateur Radio Club
LARCFest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed Elements 2 and 3, which qualifies me for an amateur radio General license! I have to wait
for my paperwork to be processed and a callsign assigned before I can operate, but I’m still
excited!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
