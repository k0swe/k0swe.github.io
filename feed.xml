&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken the plunge and started learning
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cantab.net/users/john.wiseman/Documents/BPQ32.html&quot;&gt;BPQ&lt;/a&gt; in earnest. It’s a hefty
program, and it’s clear that it has grown organically over many years. Which is to say, it’s
cantankerous to work with, but it does get the job done. I asked one of my Elmers, Willem AC0KQ,
about how to mentally model it, and he basically laughed and told me that it’s fruitless to try and
build a mental model. Just copy other people’s configuration files and modify them to your needs.
Well, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willem does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://prinmath.com/ham/&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bpq-config&lt;/code&gt; that is basically an
installer and setup wizard for LinBPQ. It assumes you’re using a Raspberry Pi and I’m not, but it
did get me a base to work from. Getting a working config means I finally have a working AX.25 and
VARA FM Winlink RMS to test Pat against!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that’s not the end of my problems for testing Pat+VARA. I’ve been using the radio
interface I recently found and love so much, the Digirig Mobile, for one side of my connection.
However, while it worked just fine for me on FT8, I’ve had some issues trying to get it to work for
AX.25 and VARA FM. I think it’s “going deaf” briefly when switching from TX back to RX, just long
enough to miss the reply in AX.25 and VARA FM. Maybe FT8’s turnaround time is just more forgiving? I
need to do more investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Progress on Pat+VARA</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2021/09/28/pat-vara-progress.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Progress on Pat+VARA" /><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2021/09/28/pat-vara-progress</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2021/09/28/pat-vara-progress.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-09-24-vara-fm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two stations running VARA FM&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time developing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpat.io/&quot;&gt;Pat&lt;/a&gt; this month. For a long time, adding
support for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winlink.org/tags/vara&quot;&gt;VARA&lt;/a&gt; transport has been a major requested
feature, but it was never prioritized because VARA is only designed for Windows, and Pat’s primary
user base is Linux &amp;amp; Raspberry Pi. However, folks in the community have been experimenting with
running VARA in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/&quot;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt;, and have even gone so far as to write an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WheezyE/Winelink&quot;&gt;installation script&lt;/a&gt;. When someone has made it this easy to
install VARA on Linux, we don’t have any excuses left to delay integrating Pat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been helping to lay some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/n8jja/Pat-Vara&quot;&gt;groundwork&lt;/a&gt; for the modem
driver. At this point I can complete an HF Winlink session, but I need to do a lot more testing
before we hand it over to the general public. I’m battling bad propagation from my QTH (home) HF
station and its poor antenna. There aren’t any VARA FM Winlink gateways within VHF distance, so I’ve
been forced to pursue setting up my own VHF Winlink RMS/gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that in turn has forced me to pursue a topic I’ve been avoiding for some time:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cantab.net/users/john.wiseman/Documents/index.html&quot;&gt;BPQ&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an extremely flexible
piece of software that at its heart wants to be a AX.25 packet radio gateway for Winlink and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system&quot;&gt;BBS&lt;/a&gt;’s, but it can be configured for much
more. Because it’s so flexible, it’s also difficult to configure. I took a look at it a couple of
years ago and decided it was too much to bite off at the time, but it’s really the tool I need for
testing Pat+VARA integration, so I’m now climbing the steep learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ARES Event: Golden Gran Fondo</title><link href="https://k0swe.radio/2021/08/31/golden-gran-fondo.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ARES Event: Golden Gran Fondo" /><published>2021-08-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-08-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://k0swe.radio/2021/08/31/golden-gran-fondo</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://k0swe.radio/2021/08/31/golden-gran-fondo.html">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I participated with my own ARES team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coaresr1d6.org/&quot;&gt;R1D6&lt;/a&gt;, in covering one
of our big annual events, the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.granfondonationalseries.com/gran-fondo-golden&quot;&gt;Golden Gran Fondo&lt;/a&gt; bicycle race. It’s an
arduous event that winds through the mountains near Golden, the longest event being 90 miles long
with about 9,000 feet of elevation gain and loss. Because the mountains have spotty cell phone
coverage, the event staff really appreciate having a team that can keep communications flowing. This

was a highly respected local ham, Dave &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WG0N&lt;/code&gt;. It was a mostly uneventful day, only a couple of
minor surprises. Most of the day we spent enjoying the beautiful views of the state park, the buzz
of athletes coming and going, and the chatter of the progress updates over the DMR talk group. All
in all it was a very pleasant day to be out playing radio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">On Sunday I participated with my own ARES team, R1D6, in covering one of our big annual events, the Golden Gran Fondo bicycle race.

sheriff’s office and the fair staff. During the course of each day, I ended up averaging about 10
miles walking. We assisted with about 10 lost child incidents where we searched for children or
parents; 3 or 4 medicals where we called the event EMTs out into the fair to help people; and asked
for sheriff support on a couple of unruly customers.
