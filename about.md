This is the personal website of amateur radio operator K0SWE, a.k.a. Chris.

I'm a professional software engineer, husband and father. I was previously a 25U (radio and IT
technician) in the US Army, and graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a bachelor's
degree in computer science. I've been on the air as a ham since April 2019.

My primary radios right now are:

* Icom IC-7300 for HF
* Kenwood TM-D710G mobile
* AnyTone D878UV for DMR
* Lab599 Discovery TX-500 for QRP

I'm a member of [RMHAM][rmham] (including the [NetOps group][netops]), [Colorado R1D6 ARES][r1d6],
[RMRL][rmrl] and [ARRL][arrl] .
