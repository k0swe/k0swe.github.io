          <p>I served in the Army Reserve from 2005 to 2011, with a deployment to Joint Base Balad, Iraq in
2008-2009. I was part of the Army Signal Corps, a 25U Signal Support Systems Specialist, essentially
a radio and IT technician; I was embedded in the S6 shops of an administrative brigade (651st ASG)
and a logistics battalion (259th CSSB).</p>

<p>The IT side was all garden-variety COTS systems like Windows XP and CAT5 cables, and most of it is
not terribly interesting to relate.</p>

<p>On the radio side, this list is some of the specialized military equipment I used.</p>

<h1 id="vhf-fm-radios">VHF FM radios</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SINCGARS">SINCGARS</a> family of radios: RT-1523, models A through F
    <ul>
      <li>The SINCGARS had data protocols available, but I only ever had a chance to use voice.</li>
      <li>The E and F were much smaller and lighter! And in manpack configuration the battery fit inside
the radio housing instead of requiring a bulky additional battery box.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.psmag.radionerds.com/index.php/OE-254/GRC">OE-254/GRC</a> mast antenna
    <ul>
      <li>This broadband biconical antenna covers 30 to 88 MHz with low SWR, perfect for frequency
hopping across the entire band on the SINCGARS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AS-3900A/VRC vehicular whip antenna</li>
  <li>AS-3683A/PRC manpack blade antenna</li>
  <li>Occasionally the AS-4266A/PRC manpack tent-pole antenna</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.prc68.com/I/H250.shtml">H250/U</a> hand mic
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t you dare try to use the H350 with SINCGARS! It looks the same and has the same plug but
an incompatible pinout.</li>
      <li>Check out this
<a href="https://www.logsa.army.mil/psmag/archives/PS2007/651/651-44-45.pdf">PS Magazine feature</a>
on the 250/350 issue. PS Magazine was always entertaining.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>LS-671/VRC loudspeaker</li>
  <li>Retransmission operations with the “dog bone” cable CX-13298
    <ul>
      <li>One time at a field exercise, I drove an hour out of base to the retrans site, only to realize
I was missing this critical component. That’s the last time I forgot to do inventory and
dry-run!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AM-7238/VRC amplifier</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="crypto-devices">Crypto devices</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Mainly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/CYZ-10">AN/CYZ-10</a> ANCD data transport device</li>
  <li>A couple of times I got to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/PYQ-10">AN/PYQ-10</a> SKL data
transport device (good ol’ Windows CE)</li>
  <li>I never used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KYK-13">KYK-13</a>, but heard many an NCO wax poetic
about their simplicity and reliability</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="gps-receivers">GPS receivers</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Lightweight_GPS_Receiver">AN/PSN-11</a> PLGR</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Advanced_GPS_Receiver">AN/PSN-13</a> DAGR</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="others">Others</h1>

<p>I was trained on several systems in AIT that I never got to use in the field.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tactical Satellite (TACSAT) - I believe on the AN/PRC-117 with an AV 2040 antenna.</li>
  <li>Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) - a tactical cell phone system</li>
  <li>TA-1042A/U Digital Non-Secure Voice Terminal (DNVT) - wired field telephones</li>
  <li>Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) - a data network similar to APRS
    <ul>
      <li>Features its own TDOA locating that can be used in GPS-denied environments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) and Blue Force Tracker (BFT)</li>
</ul>

<p>While it wasn’t exactly a 25U responsibility, one year for Annual Training I helped set
up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integrated_laser_engagement_system">MILES</a>
gear for our unit.</p>
