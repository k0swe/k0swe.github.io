I mentioned in an earlier post that I had pre-ordered a Lab599 Discovery TX-500 QRP HF transceiver.
I had hoped Santa Claus would put it under the Christmas tree for me, but Lab599 and HRO delivered
not long after. I'm so excited!

I took it out for a spin for the first time last week. I set up in Founders Park in Superior during
lunchtime. I paired the TX-500 with a Chameleon MPAS 2.0 in vertical configuration using the MIL
whip and extension, and the combination performed much better than I could have ever hoped. I got my
first European contact ever: `EA2CCG` from Spain over 20m FT8!

Yesterday I took it out again, this time in Westminster City Park, and again with the Chameleon MPAS
but this time using the SS17 telescoping whip. This time I got my second European contact: `LA5KO`
in Norway on 20m FT8.

It really reinforces for me an oft-repeated fact: the antenna is the most important part of the
radio. After having never made an EU contact at home with 100W available, I was able to make both of
these EU contacts on less than 10W of power, and I'm convinced that the biggest difference was the
antenna. At home I'm using a Chameleon EMCOMM II end-fed long wire, which gets the job done and is
HOA-friendly, but it's right up against my house and I'm sure it's not doing a great job. Getting
out into the park with an open area has really made a difference. I don't need 100W if I have the
right antenna!

I'm looking forward to more experimentation with the TX-500. So far, I'm very, very impressed!
