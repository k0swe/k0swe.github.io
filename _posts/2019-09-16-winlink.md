Winlink of course started out being a Microsoft Windows-based product, and Winlink 2000 still seems
to be the most popular client software out there. I figured it was time to at least make sure I
could use this more conventional configuration.

The most conventional setup I know of is using a radio with a built-in TNC like a Kenwood TM-D710,
but I don't have anything like that. I was able to get these two configurations working with
Windows:

I'm still going to avoid Windows when possible, but it's good to know I'm not completely inept with
it.
