![Finished `K3NG` keyer project](/assets/2020-05-25-k3ng-finished.jpg)

After some [fussing](/2020/05/02/pcb-design.html) and
[fiddling](/2020/05/19/pcb-troubleshooting.html), my custom `K3NG` Morse keyer with an Arduino
shield PCB is complete! As input, it can accept a straight key, paddles with a knob for speed
control, or the Winkeyer computer interface; for output, it has a side-tone speaker with a headphone
bypass and volume knob, and a separate transceiver output port.

It can be used as a code practice oscillator, an automatic keyer, or a Winkeyer interface. It's
somewhat redundant as an automatic keyer because most modern radios have that built-in, but it would
still help in keeping both a straight key and paddles plugged in simultaneously.

It's not a super complex device, but it was a good opportunity to learn more complex circuits than
just "microcontroller pin goes to component," PCB design, and now I have a dedicated practice
oscillator and Winkeyer interface. I'm happy!
