I joined about 40 hams from Colorado AuxComm, several ARES districts and the Rocky Mountain Ham
Radio group to provide race communications for the Dirty 30, a 30 mile/50 km ultra trail run through
Golden Gate Canyon State Park. Our mission is to make sure that every runner that steps on the
mountainous, dispersed course also steps off at the end of the day, and by all accounts, 2019 was a
very good year for the comms team.

My aid station (#3, Horseshoe Trailhead) started the day with no RFID mat to automatically read
bibs, so I spent the morning manually entering bib numbers into my laptop, connected via Wi-Fi and
microwave back to the comm trailer running the centralized race web server.
