The COVID-19 pandemic has of course kept us mostly at home and away from people for over a year now.
But with wide-spread vaccinations, the grip of the pandemic is starting to loosen. Case in point:
last night, [Colorado ARES R1D6](https://www.coaresr1d6.org/) was able to meet in-person for the
first time since February 2020!

We worked on initiating [ARRL ARES](http://www.arrl.org/ares) Task Books. Most members of the unit
have the training to complete Level 1 of the task book without effort, so we worked on some Level 2
skills like front-panel programming a radio, and taking a field report on an ICS-213 with sufficient
detail. It was a lot of fun to see folks in-person again!
