My amateur radio license has been assigned! For now, I'm KE0VJM. I've been listening to the bands a
bit on a Baofeng UV-5R. I've heard some negative reviews about their effects on the ham bands, so I
probably won't stick with it for long, but at $20 you can't beat the price!

Since I passed my general-class exam, I'm eligible for a shorter vanity callsign, so I might apply
for that soon.
