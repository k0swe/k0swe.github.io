I was able to get out for a little while today. I worked a little FT-8, and had planned to do some
voice. I started to get a little rain, which I was prepared for. But then the rain picked up and I
had to disassemble.

The major station components this year consisted of:

- Lab599 Discovery TX500 QRP HF transceiver
- Chameleon MPAS 2.0 antenna in SS-17 vertical configuration
- MFJ-9201 QRPocket manual antenna tuner
- Panasonic CF-19 rugged laptop
- `K0TX` Digirig Mobile v1.6 radio to computer interface
- Bioenno BLF-1230A battery in a Powerwerx MegaBox
- Powerwerx FSP-110W solar panels and MPPT-150-14.6 charge controller
