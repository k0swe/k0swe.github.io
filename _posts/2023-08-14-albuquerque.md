title: "ARRL Rocky Mountain Division Convention in Albuquerque"

This year's ARRL Rocky Mountain Division Convention was this past weekend in Albuquerque. The
original planners had backed out a couple of months before their event, so the Rocky Mountain Ham
New Mexico team quickly threw together a replacement event. I attended both because I had never been
to a division convention before, plus to be an extra hand to the RMHAM NM team.

There was meant to be a [Very Large Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array) tour the
Friday before the event, but unfortunately that was cancelled due to a power outage. Instead, many
of the RMHAM Colorado folks and I travelled a short way to Los Alamos to experience the Bradbury
Museum and the Fuller Lodge.

After that, the event proper was underway.
