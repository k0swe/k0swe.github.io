I had a chance this weekend to install new antennas: an NMO mount for my truck (in addition to the
car I did a few months ago) and a VHF/UHF J-pole in the attic. The NMO install went a little
smoother in the truck than it did in the car, I suppose due to experience, but also because the
larger cab and larger headliner meant I didn't feel the need to take both B and C pillar trim panels
off, just one side of the truck. The attic antenna went well enough, although my attic has a shorter
peak than I remembered, only about 5 feet. The
[Arrow OSJ 146/440](http://www.arrowantennas.com/osj/j-pole.html) I bought barely fit. However, it's
performing really well: hooked up to my new Kenwood TM-D710G, I'm getting APRS packets from up to
110 miles away! I'm not even in that advantageous of a location. (I neglected to check if those were
via digipeater, but regardless, I'm happy!)

I tested out the new D710/attic antenna combo by trying to work the ISS APRS digipeater. It was a
little challenging to figure out the different configuration options for PATH and such, but it was
worth it. I was able to get packets through the ISS digipeater!

I'm pleased as punch! `AD7FC` is over in Yakima, Washington. There's definitely room for improvement
on the performance of this system for ISS APRS, maybe with the Arrow hand-held Yagi and actually
tracking instead of relying on raw power and a vertical antenna. But not bad for a first attempt!
