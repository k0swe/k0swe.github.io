I've been following
[Dave Casler `KE0OG`'s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaBtYooQdmNzq63eID8RaLQ) YouTube videos
since I started ham radio. (Which was only a year ago, but still...) I really appreciate his pacing
and style: many hams on YouTube have developed a more flashy, fast-talking flair, but sometimes they
feel like click-bait and can get overwhelming to watch. With Dave, it feels like I'm sitting in the
shack learning something from my Elmer.

On yesterday's live-stream, Dave
[answered my question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1UXHGLYZZk&t=4103) about FT8! I noticed that
the radio transmits much more power if I use an FT8 slot around 2,000 Hz than if I use 300 Hz, and
Dave pointed out that the normal SSB audio bandwidth only accepts audio frequencies between around
400 to 2,500 Hz. He didn't say this, but it made me realize that I can change the dial frequency to
effectively access those lower and higher FT8 slots, and that I really only have a little over 2 kHz
of useful transmit bandwidth. Good advice, thank you!
