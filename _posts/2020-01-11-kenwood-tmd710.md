I've been looking at mobile radios for a while, but the difficult thing about it is that there's no
radio that does everything. I've been looking at:

- VHF/UHF radios that support digital voice modes like DMR, or
- VHF/UHF radios that include a TNC and APRS, or
- all-band radios that do HF in addition to VHF/UHF, or
- HF-only rigs.

Choosing one means giving up on the other modes, or running multiple radios which multiplies cost
and complexity. After much humming and hawing, I decided that packet is one of the things I'd most
like to master (even though the prevalence of packet is supposedly much reduced from its heyday), so
I chose what seems to be the most popular dual-bander with a TNC.

The Kenwood TM-D710G puts out 50W on the 2m and 70cm bands, which is an order of magnitude more
power than the HTs I've been using. It has a well-integrated TNC which supports APRS (with built-in
GPS for location), and also more general packet/AX.25 communications, even digipeater operation.

Beyond that, it can do cross-band repeating, which is very similar to the SINCGARS retrans I used to
do in the Army. Doing cross-band repeating can allow your vehicle to act as a high-power base
station that can connect back to a permanent repeater on one end, and connect one or more low-power
HTs on the other end, which can be very handy.

There are many good YouTube videos for learning different features. I very much appreciated intro
videos from [Jim `KA6ETE`](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo6nMzKerap6RQqS1Va4sTQ). A
[couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyv56yyi-u4) of people have videos of working the ISS APRS
digipeater, which would be interesting to try in conjunction with prepping for ARISS. There's even a
video of someone [using DTMF for remote control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo-yigpYj4s);
that's a bit beyond me at the moment, but it's nice to know it's there.

All in all, this radio feels a lot more powerful and feature-rich than even my AnyTone AT-D878UV.
I'm excited to explore this and see what it can do!
