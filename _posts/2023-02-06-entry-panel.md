The move has been going well. We're mostly settled in, and ham-wise I've been able to limp along
with a window coax passthrough to my temporary station.

But today, I did the scariest thing since cutting a hole in the roof of my car: I cut a hole in the
side of my house! I purchased an entry panel from
[KF7P Metalwerks](https://www.kf7p.com/KF7P/Welcome.html), and it looks excellent. The process of
cutting the hole was nerve-wracking, but it went smoothly. The panel came with a section of conduit,
so getting the panel placed correctly and weather sealed was easy. I'm very happy with the result.
I'll be able to establish a good ground system and run plenty of cables through the panel.

The first thing I ran through was actually an ethernet cable for a microwave hop up to Eldorado
Mountain and directly into the RMHAM backbone! I'll get my UHF/VHF J-pole and HF long wire set up
soon.
