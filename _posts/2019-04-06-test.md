After a couple of weeks of studying for the amateur radio technician-level exam and cramming
last-minute for the general-level, I took my test today at the annual Longmont Amateur Radio Club
LARCFest.

I passed Elements 2 and 3, which qualifies me for an amateur radio General license! I have to wait
for my paperwork to be processed and a callsign assigned before I can operate, but I'm still
excited!
