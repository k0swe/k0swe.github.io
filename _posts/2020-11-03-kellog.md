I've been busy coding on my new contact logging application, and I'm happy to say that it's becoming
useful enough to use it as my day-to-day logger. What's more, my employer has released any copyright
claims, so I can now open-source the whole thing! Check out the [website](https://forester.radio)
and the [code](https://github.com/k0swe/kellog).

The logger consists of a hosted website which syncs almost instantly between machines thanks to
being backed by Firebase. That on its own might not be very interesting, but as I've
[hinted before](/2020/07/19/grounding.html), I built a small translator program that lets the
website talk to WSJT-X and can be extended to other radio software. There are some web-based loggers
that can talk to desktop radio software, but the ones I've seen have to be served from the same
machine. I think I've built something novel: the first _hosted_ web logger that can talk to desktop
radio software. And I've built it to be modular enough that folks can build on what I've started.

There are still plenty of missing features and rough edges to work out, but I'm very pleased that
it's at a point that it's usable.
