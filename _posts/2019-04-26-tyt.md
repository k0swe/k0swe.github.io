While working analog FM, I've heard several folks mention digital modes. There are a couple of
competing standards, but it sounds like locally in the Denver area, DMR is the most popular. In
light of that, I picked up a TYT MD-380 dual-band DMR handheld. It's certainly nice to have
something more sophisticated than the Baofeng I've been using.

Luckily, it uses the same Kenwood K1 style plug, so headsets and hand mics will be compatible
between them.
