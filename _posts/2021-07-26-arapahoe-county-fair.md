For the past 4 days I was assisting [Arapahoe County ARES](https://arapahoeares.org/) with the
[Arapahoe County Fair](https://www.arapahoecountyfair.com/). I'm not sure what I was expecting, but
this event turned out to be very challenging and gratifying!

My role was to walk around the fair as part of a team of 2 or 3 and be extra eyes and ears for the
sheriff's office and the fair staff. During the course of each day, I ended up averaging about 10
miles walking. We assisted with about 10 lost child incidents where we searched for children or
parents; 3 or 4 medicals where we called the event EMTs out into the fair to help people; and asked
for sheriff support on a couple of unruly customers. Good times!
