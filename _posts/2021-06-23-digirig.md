After all that work on [Mountaineer](https://github.com/k0swe/mountaineer), I recently found someone
who was working on a similar project: [Digirig Mobile](https://digirig.net/product/digirig-mobile/)
by Denis Grisak `K0TX`. It's pretty much identical in feature set, a quarter of the size, is
similarly [open source](https://github.com/softcomplex/digirig) and was designed by an actual
electrical engineer who knows what he is doing. After building cables to interface with the TX-500,
it's working perfectly!

I spoke with Denis over email and he gave me some ideas to improve Mountaineer. I'm grateful, but
for now, I think I'm just going to stop development on Mountaineer and guide people towards Digirig.

In a way, I'm a little relieved. It was a lot of fun developing Mountaineer and building my hardware
skills, but the thought of productionizing it, mass-producing, having to deal with logistics and
payments and customer service... It's all more than I really wanted to pursue. I'll leave that to
someone with a more entrepreneurial spirit!
