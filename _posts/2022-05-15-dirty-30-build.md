I spent the day in Evergreen helping with the [Dirty 30](https://dirty30.org/) communications dry
run. We set up the comms trailer, all 5 aid stations and checkpoints, and the network center point
at City Lights Ridge. This is a critical day every year to make sure we have everything connected
and ready to deploy the day before the race. A couple of the sites have to be hiked into the
mountains, so making sure all of the gear is present and working is incredibly important.

I focused on City Lights Ridge since I'm going to be stationed there again during the race. It's not
the most complex site, but because it's the network's central point, it talks to pretty much all of
the other sites. It needs to be set up early and run smoothly. Hopefully the work I did today will
ensure success at the race.
