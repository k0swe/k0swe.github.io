![Raspberry Pi and SignaLink USB in a car](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6jOsYnLkZFw/XXQg1L8wzLI/AAAAAAABp3Y/69zVzjRIcvIIkzCrohLp948roUx4akR_QCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190818_195256.jpg)

After getting
[PiPat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJY5iXwyYGQgYm9Cp68SarbZO_Nobx-BP2fhIsRSx08/preview)
to work, I was curious to get something running with more "conventional" hardware. I'd heard a lot
about [Dire Wolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf), so I picked up a
[Signalink USB](http://www.tigertronics.com/slusbmain.htm) sound card/interface device and set about
using that with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and [Pat](https://github.com/la5nta/pat).

I got it working relatively well. You can see in the photo, the TNC-Pi is still attached to the
Raspberry Pi, but it's not being used for this configuration. I documented my Dire Wolf setup as an
appendix in the
[PiPat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJY5iXwyYGQgYm9Cp68SarbZO_Nobx-BP2fhIsRSx08/preview#heading=h.6y5tpvy10jdg)
documentation.
