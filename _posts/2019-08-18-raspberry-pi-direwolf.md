![Raspberry Pi and SignaLink USB in a car](/assets/2019-08-18-pi-signalink.jpg)

After getting [PiPat](https://bit.ly/k0swe-pipat) to work, I was curious to get something running
with more "conventional" hardware. I'd heard a lot about
[Dire Wolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf), so I picked up a
[Signalink USB](http://www.tigertronics.com/slusbmain.htm) sound card/interface device and set about
using that with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and [Pat](https://github.com/la5nta/pat).

I got it working relatively well. You can see in the photo, the TNC-Pi is still attached to the
Raspberry Pi, but it's not being used for this configuration. I documented my Dire Wolf setup as an
appendix in the [PiPat](https://bit.ly/k0swe-pipat) documentation.
