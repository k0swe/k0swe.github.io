I was looking forward to using [PiGate](http://pigate.net/) on my TNC-Pi rig as a Winlink client,
but the pre-built disk images don't work with my hardware (Raspberry Pi 3B+). The
integrator/maintainer of PiGate, Mark Griffith `KD0QYN`, told me that building a new image is
getting harder because Raspbian has moved to PHP7, and SquirrelMail is incompatible and is not
likely to be updated.

Instead, I set about setting up something similar with [Pat](http://getpat.io/)
and setting up the Pi in Wi-Fi AP mode. There are only a couple of Winlink RMSs on VHF in my area,
and none that I can reach from my house on my current equipment, so I've been driving to a nearby
hill with good line-of-sight. I can power the Pi with a USB battery, connect my phone or laptop to
the Wi-Fi AP, and go to town with the Pat web application! I call it
[PiPat](https://bit.ly/k0swe-pipat).
