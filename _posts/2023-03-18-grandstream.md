As a follow-up to my [previous post](/2023/03/03/pbx.html) on IP phones, I picked up a
[Grandstream GXP1625](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VNMWRFK/) for still pretty cheap. Let me
tell you how much easier it was to set up with both FreePBX and Hamshack Hotline! The phone has a
web interface, and it was a breeze to configure. I didn't have to mess with XML files or TFTP
servers. I pointed the phone at Hamshack Hotline and my own experimental FreePBX server, and it just
worked. So much easier than the Cisco phone.
