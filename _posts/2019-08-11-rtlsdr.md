I'm intrigued by software-defined radios, which are the cutting edge in radio technology and have a
much wider operating range than their discrete component cousins. When I saw that one popular model
was $20, I picked one up on a whim without really knowing what to expect.

I had purchased an [RTL-SDR Blog V3 kit](https://amzn.com/B011HVUEME). I was just a tad disappointed
to learn it's a receive-only SDR, but for the price, I wasn't expecting perfection. I found a couple
of YouTube [videos](https://youtu.be/9QzklSyKqQM) to give me some ideas for things to try.

Since I run Linux primarily, I found that [Gqrx](http://gqrx.dk/download/install-ubuntu) was a good
starting point. It wasn't too difficult to get installed and running. This is my first experience
with waterfall displays and being able to quickly tune around. It's fun looking at broadcast FM
stations to see which ones have digital sidebands, or scrolling around in the ham bands to find
transmissions like little caterpillars running down the screen. I can definitely see where this will
be a nice tool in my ham radio toolbox.
