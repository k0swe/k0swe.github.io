My family and I are moving! It's only a short distance, but it still means I need to take down all
of the permanently installed shack components like my QTH antennas. I'll have to rely on my mobile
and portable gear for a while. It also means I won't have much spare time for ham projects until
everything is moved.

As luck would have it, Dave Casler just posted a video about a practice that luckily I've already
been following: [Keep the boxes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TvdvcE2cJQ) That should make the
move (at least for the shack) a lot easier.

Wish us luck!
