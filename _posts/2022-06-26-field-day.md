Yesterday, my daughter Kaylee and I drove up to Park County, Colorado to take part in
[Rocky Mountain Ham Radio](https://rmham.org/)'s expedition for
[ARRL Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day)! Despite hanging out with RMHAM for a few years now,
this is the first time I've made the pilgrimage. The site is an empty mountain residential lot about
2 hours from metro Denver where I live, so it's a bit of a trek. However, it was definitely worth
it!

Kaylee and I were greeted by a small city of about 10 RVs plus several comm vans and trailers. All
told, about 30 folks were running 3 "official" transmitters plus a few accessory ones, running
voice, CW and FT8 over many bands.

Kaylee isn't licensed yet, but she got to try out a few HF contacts at the Get-On-The-Air station!

Despite all the awesomeness happening, I think Kaylee's favorite part of the trip was dinner! I got
to have some eyeball QSOs (contacts) with some of my favorite folks in the community, and the food
was fantastic!

Kaylee and I only stayed for a few hours, but I think I have a partner in crime to convince the rest
of the family to come make a camping/RV trip next year! I'll have to start working with Kaylee on
getting her own callsign, too.
