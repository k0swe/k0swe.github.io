I've been switching my focus more to the software engineering side of the hobby. I've been getting
more and more involved in [Pat](https://github.com/la5nta/pat) and have been particularly interested
in the form templates features, which has been available as a beta feature for about a year now. I
can't take credit for most of the form templates code, most of that was written by Rainer
Grosskopf `KI7RMJ`, but I was able to nudge Pat's founder, Martin Pedersen `LA5NTA`, into creating a
new release.

So far, most of the feedback is very positive! There are a couple of bugs to fix and necessary UX
improvements to make, but at least it's out there in the world!
