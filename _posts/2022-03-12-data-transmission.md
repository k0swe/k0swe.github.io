Earlier today I was one of the presenters at another [RMHAM](https://www.rmham.org/) University
session: Data Transmission via Radio. I joined John `W0VG`, Willem `AC0KQ` and Gary `WB5PJB` in
talking about the Winlink email ecosystem from many different angles.

I was given the task of figuring out how to talk about protocols in an understandable way, and I
hope I did the topic justice. I also had a chance to talk about my favorite little Winlink client,
[Pat](https://getpat.io). Of course, anyone who keeps up with my dealings knows that I'm a regular
contributor to Pat, and it was great to sing its virtues to another crowd.
