Last weekend I was very lucky to get an in-depth look at
[RMHAM's microwave network](https://www.rmham.org/wordpress/amateur-microwave-network/) by being
invited to a workshop on the subject. It's an IP-over-microwave network spanning New Mexico to
Wyoming and Pueblo to Grand Junction. It's an extensive system that carries various amateur radio
traffic; for example, it functions as part of the backbone for the
[Colorado Connection](https://colcon.org/wp/) repeater network.

To complete the workshop I had to dust off a lot of networking knowledge I haven't exercised in a
long time, particularly OSPF. It's all fun and games until a rogue static route is breaking routing
everywhere!

It was a very illuminating class, and hopefully I can start to repay the kindness of the
facilitators, Willem Schreuder `AC0KQ` and John Maxwell `W0VG`, by giving back in some fashion. They
have some custom software which manages their configuration and tooling, maybe I can beef that up.

## But Why?

We didn't talk much in the workshop about the network's purpose. Why not have the Colorado
Connection and other clients backed by commercial internet? I guess the answer is that we want to be
independent of the internet to mitigate ISP failures, but that's increasingly rare. For me there's a
more foundational reason for the RMHAM network to exist: it keeps ham radio on ham radio.

I've heard of lots of hams using digital hotspots and the internet to connect to repeaters
worldwide. Hotspots give users access to multiple digital modes and extend the reach of a humble HT
beyond ~30 miles, so they're great tools. But on some level it feels like cheating. What's the
difference between using a Zumspot to join a reflector vs using Discord to join a voice chat room,
the fact that you're going traveling 5 feet over ham frequencies? The advent of the cell phone, and
especially the smartphone, has made the ability to communicate wirelessly to anyone worldwide a
commodity; what makes ham radio still interesting is that _we can do it without commercial
infrastructure_. I won't knock anyone who enjoys using a hotspot as a tool to practice the hobby,
but showing a non-ham a hotspot is not going to convince them to get into the hobby. We need to tout
why ham radio is different from a cell phone.

That's what makes systems like the RMHAM network worthwhile. The fact that the Colorado Connection
is independent of commercial infrastructure keeps it "real" ham radio in my mind. The fact that we
get to conceive, install, tinker, keep it running and are not beholden to anyone's decisions outside
our community, the fact that hams have built it from the ground up, that's what makes it
special.</div></div>
