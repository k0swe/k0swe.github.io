Yesterday was quite a hoot; first I participated in an ARES exercise, then in my first Winter Field
Day!

For the ARES exercise, our team (R1D6 covering Jefferson, Gilpin and Clear Creek counties)
was assisting our neighbors Denver ARES with connectivity checks. I wouldn't say it was exciting
sitting in a hospital parking lot and collecting radio checks, but it gave us a lot of great data
about where we would and would not be able to reach if the repeaters were down. This could end up
being very valuable information should we ever need it.

After that, I went and operated outdoors for my first Winter Field Day. I was very thankful that it
was a balmy 50Â°F, but even in nice winter weather like that, I still got pretty chilled sitting
around for a couple of hours. I worked some SSB and JS8Call on 20m using my new Lab599 Discovery
TX-500, and I'm still in love with the thing! QRP being what it is, I wasn't able to break up
dogpiles, but when I was heard, I had no issues.
