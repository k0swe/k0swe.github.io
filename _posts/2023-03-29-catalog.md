title: "ARES Catalog"

It seems I've been roped into another project. Colorado ARES section leaders want to create a
catalog of important information for use by ARES groups across the state. It will include things
like ICS 217s describing all of the repeaters and channels used by each group, ICS 205s to break
those channels down per-event, and ICS 205As with contact information of event personnel. I've been
tasked with creating a web application to collect and display this information. I'm just one of
several people working on this project, but I'm the only one with web development experience. Ben
`KB0UBZ` is technically savvy and is willing to help collect and massage data. Our subject matter
experts are Joe `KD0TYU` and Randy `N0OEM`.

At this point, we're really trying to narrow down exactly what we're trying to build in the first
place. Willem `AC0KQ` pitched this project to me as somthing to fill out complete Incident Action
Plans with many ICS forms, but Joe and Randy's vision for this as a catalog is quite different. I
think we'll start with the bare minimum, just publishe ICS 217s organized by ARES group, and then
build from there.
