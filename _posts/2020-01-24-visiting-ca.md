This week I had a work trip to the south Bay Area in California, and took an HT to try my hand at
making some local repeater contacts there. I had a couple of nice rag-chews. I learned a lot more
about using the Anytone D878 in VFO mode and with front-panel programming; I get spoiled around home
having the luxury of pre-programming everything with software and transferring code-plugs.

I also took a new ZUMspot hotspot, but didn't have much opportunity to use it. At the office I had a
great view of the local repeaters from a high floor and didn't really need the hotspot; at the
hotel, the Wi-Fi had a captive portal and I didn't have a good way to connect it.
