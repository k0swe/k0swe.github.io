My work on splitting out individual prototypes of the USB hub, serial adapter and sound card has
paid off! I have working prototypes of all three, and a lot more experience with what support
components are necessary and which are just "nice to have."

Based on this new experience, I've started reworking my original design. I also tried out JLCPCB's
assembly service, and while they probably can't build the whole thing (don't have all the parts I
need in stock), they can at least get all the teeny tiny 0603 resistors and capacitors.

Onward!
