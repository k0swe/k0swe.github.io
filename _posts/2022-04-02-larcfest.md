I made it down to [Longmont Amateur Radio Club](https://w0eno.org/)'s annual-once-again swapfest. I
took my youngest daughter who had a marvelous time running around, greeting all of the vendors and
looking at all of the bits and bobs. I didn't find any treasures, but it was great to get some
eyeball QSOs with folks I hadn't seen in a while. I'm glad these events are finally starting again!
