It's slowly become clear that my penchant for Chromebooks (cheap and simple to manage) will not get
me far in amateur radio. After
[asking the internet for recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/drmfhh/advice_for_a_hamfriendly_laptop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
and getting a lot great advice, I picked up a Panasonic Toughbook CF-19 MK5. It's 8 year old
hardware at this point, but:

* it sounds like most ham applications don't require much in the way of CPU or memory,  
* the IP65 water resistance and general indestructibility is a big plus, and
* they're a bargain at ~$300.

Compare that to a brand new "spill-resistant" Lenovo X1 Carbon at $1,500!

I've installed Xubuntu 19.10 on it, and the experience was pretty seamless. A couple of notes:

* The touchscreen works, although I can't figure out how to calibrate it yet. As usual, I'm
  [asking the internet](https://askubuntu.com/q/1188624/129686).
* The speaker didn't work directly after install, but after playing around in `alsamixer` and
  raising all of the channel levels, I was able to get it working.
* The front buttons don't work out of the box, but apparently there's a driver running around called
  `panasonic-hbtn.zip`. I'll have to track that down.
* Mine didn't come with a GPS module, but eBay has second-hand parts going for $35, so that'll be a
  nice addition.
