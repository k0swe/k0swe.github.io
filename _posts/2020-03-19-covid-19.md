The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has certainly hit the US like a ton of bricks in the last 2 weeks.
I'm working from home, my kids are schooling for home, and practically every event involving more
than 10 people has been cancelled. Unfortunately, that included several emergency communications
meetings and trainings that I was looking forward to.

Instead, I'm taking the opportunity to work on more resilient VHF packet radio and Winlink
configurations. When I was heavily into this several months ago, I was primarily using an Anytone
AT-D878UV, but I've noticed that while it's better than the cheapo Baofeng UV-5R, it's still not
great about switching between receive and transmit as quickly as packet requires. One of the radios
in Alan's SK collection is a Kenwood TM-261 VHF-only mobile rig, which is perfect as a base in my
shack.

I got the 261 working for packet today with the SignaLink USB, Direwolf and Pat, and it runs like a
champ! I put it on the Arrow OSJ in the attic and was able to reliably transfer Winlink emails with
10 watts, even through the wet spring snow storm we're currently experiencing. I've spent so long
tinkering with packet over Chinese handhelds that it's really refreshing to have a setup that just
works. This gives me more confidence to explore other facets of packet like BBS and
keyboard-to-keyboard chat.

Incidentally, to integrate the SignaLink USB and the Kenwood TM-261, I ordered jumper module
SLMODR4K and radio cable SLCABRJ4 from Tigertronics. It occurred to me after I placed the order that
SLCABRJ4 is probably a straight-through ethernet cable since both the SignaLink and 261 use RJ-45
jacks, and it turns out that's true. I could've saved a few dollars by not buying that cable, but
I've been very happy with the SignaLink and happy to support Tigertronics. I'll just have to be more
careful in the future.
