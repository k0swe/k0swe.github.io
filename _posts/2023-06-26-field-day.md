I'm just coming back from another fabulous Field Day spent with RMHAM! Words hardly do the event
justice, so take a look at some of the pictures!

This was my family's first RV trip, so we rented from Cruise America and had a wonderful time. This
was also my first time taking the entire clan up to Field Day. I got all of them on the Get On The
Air (GOTA) station to make a few contacts, and my older daughter is seriously hooked! She made
almost 30 QSOs and probably would have kept going if there had been time.
