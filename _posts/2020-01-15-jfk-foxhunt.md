Today I helped a team from RMHAM to introduce some students from JFK High School to amateur radio
ahead of our potential ARISS contact. We did a quick lecture as an overview of amateur radio, then
took the students out for radio direction finding, commonly known in the hobby as foxhunting. The
foxhunt was meant to teach the kids about directional antennas and give them a hands-on activity.

This was my first experience with foxhunting, and I really enjoyed it. However, I wasn't very
skilled at guiding my group of students. I'll have to practice this later.
