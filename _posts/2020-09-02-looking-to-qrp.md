Work is continuing on my new web-based logger program, but in the meantime I've gotten more serious
about putting together a kit for [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/) and [POTA](https://pota.us/)
activations. SOTA combines ham radio with hiking, so everything needs to be rugged, small and
lightweight. Low-power QRP gear is popular in this arena, and I'm excited to have placed a pre-order
for my first QRP transceiver: the [Lab599](https://lab599.com/) Discovery TX-500.

Some things that exited me about the TX-500 are its SDR architecture, large panadapter display
(something my IC-718 at home doesn't even have) and extremely durable and water resistant machined
aluminum case. Reviews from folks like Josh `KI6NAZ` and Julian `OH8STN` were very informative about
its capabilities and limitations.

Some have criticized the TX-500 for missing features like a built-in battery, tuner and in-body
speaker. And yeah, if I already owned an Elecraft or Xiegu QRP transceiver, it would be hard to
justify getting this as a second QRP radio. But I really highly prize the water resistance, thermal
considerations and the ruggedness of the case, so I'll give this a try.

The package is supposed to come with most of the necessary cables to adapt the unconventional
water-resistant GX-12 connectors to more standard connectors, like a 3.5mm jack for a CW
key/paddles, and an unterminated power cable. The one cable that doesn't seem to come in the package
is the audio cable for digital modes, so I've taken a little time to plan out how I'm going to build
my own and order parts. The standard audio cable shown in the manual has two 3.5mm plugs for a sound
card; I'm used to using the SignaLink USB, so I'm planning a cable for use with that.
