I purchased a [TNC-Pi 2](https://tnc-x.com/TNCPi.htm) from Coastal Chipworks (John Hansen, `W2FS`).
It took longer than I'd like to admit to assemble, but I did get it working. So far I've gotten
[XASTIR](https://xastir.org/index.php/Main_Page) for APRS working (had to build from source), and
been able to view local RF station reports, view APRS-IS data and even published RF messages to the
internet as an IGate.

If I continue playing with APRS, I'll probably look at
[YAAC](http://www.ka2ddo.org/ka2ddo/YAAC.html). XASTIR works and is full-featured and mature, but
that UI is showing its age. I'd also like a headless IGate option, and
[javAPRSSrvr](http://www.aprs-is.net/javAPRSSrvr/)
sounds like a solid option.

I'd still like to play around with Winlink and PiGate, and see that the TNC's transmit is working
along with receive.
