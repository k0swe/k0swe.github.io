## Radio-specifics

### TYT MD-380

- [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools) and
  [md380tools-vm](https://github.com/KD4Z/md380tools-vm): This looks like a great improvement for
  the TYT MD-380, but I don't think it was compatible with the V05.01 hardware that I got. I
  encountered an [analog squelch issue](https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/14604/14609) I couldn't
  resolve. The md380tools repo is currently based on D013.020. I was able to get the radio working
  again with stock D015.001.

### AnyTone D878UV

- Jim Blocker KF5IW continuously updates and publishes a
  [DMR contact list](https://kf5iw.com/contactdb.php) with worldwide coverage from sources like
  radioid.net, so you can always tell who's talking.
- Dave Casler KE0OG has a [helpful video](https://youtu.be/MjnmOmSdqVU) on setting up the AnyTone
  D878UV for APRS, because it's not intuitive (at least, not as a first-time APRS user).

## Software

- Since I primarily use Linux and many radio programs are built for Windows, I use Virtualbox to run
  Windows as a guest within Linux. There's a
  [good guide](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/programming-anytone-d878uv-on-linux-using-windows10-and-virtualbox/)
  from Fran√ßois Marier VA7GPL; I had missed the point about the `vboxusers` group, and it prevented
  me from attaching USB devices.
