I served in the Army Reserve from 2005 to 2011, with a deployment to Joint Base Balad, Iraq in
2008-2009. I was part of the Army Signal Corps, a 25U Signal Support Systems Specialist, essentially
a radio and IT technician; I was embedded in the S6 shops of an administrative brigade (651st ASG)
and a logistics battalion (259th CSSB).

The IT side was all garden-variety COTS systems like Windows XP and CAT5 cables, and most of it is
not terribly interesting to relate.

On the radio side, this list is some of the specialized military equipment I used.

# VHF FM radios

* [SINCGARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SINCGARS) family of radios: RT-1523, models A through F
    * The SINCGARS had data protocols available, but I only ever had a chance to use voice.
    * The E and F were much smaller and lighter! And in manpack configuration the battery fit inside
      the radio housing instead of requiring a bulky additional battery box.
* [OE-254/GRC](http://www.psmag.radionerds.com/index.php/OE-254/GRC) mast antenna
    * This broadband biconical antenna covers 30 to 88 MHz with low SWR, perfect for frequency
      hopping across the entire band on the SINCGARS.
* AS-3900A/VRC vehicular whip antenna
* AS-3683A/PRC manpack blade antenna
* Occasionally the AS-4266A/PRC manpack tent-pole antenna
* [H250/U](http://www.prc68.com/I/H250.shtml) hand mic
    * Don't you dare try to use the H350 with SINCGARS! It looks the same and has the same plug but
      an incompatible pinout.
    * Check out this
      [PS Magazine feature](https://www.logsa.army.mil/psmag/archives/PS2007/651/651-44-45.pdf)
      on the 250/350 issue. PS Magazine was always entertaining.
* LS-671/VRC loudspeaker
* Retransmission operations with the "dog bone" cable CX-13298
    * One time at a field exercise, I drove an hour out of base to the retrans site, only to realize
      I was missing this critical component. That's the last time I forgot to do inventory and
      dry-run!
* AM-7238/VRC amplifier

# Crypto devices

* Mainly the [AN/CYZ-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/CYZ-10) ANCD data transport device
* A couple of times I got to use the [AN/PYQ-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/PYQ-10) SKL data
  transport device (good ol' Windows CE)
* I never used the [KYK-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KYK-13), but heard many an NCO wax poetic
  about their simplicity and reliability

# GPS receivers

* [AN/PSN-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Lightweight_GPS_Receiver) PLGR
* [AN/PSN-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Advanced_GPS_Receiver) DAGR

# Others

I was trained on several systems in AIT that I never got to use in the field.

* Tactical Satellite (TACSAT) - I believe on the AN/PRC-117 with an AV 2040 antenna.
* Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) - a tactical cell phone system
* TA-1042A/U Digital Non-Secure Voice Terminal (DNVT) - wired field telephones
* Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) - a data network similar to APRS
    * Features its own TDOA locating that can be used in GPS-denied environments
* Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) and Blue Force Tracker (BFT)

While it wasn't exactly a 25U responsibility, one year for Annual Training I helped set
up [MILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integrated_laser_engagement_system)
gear for our unit.
