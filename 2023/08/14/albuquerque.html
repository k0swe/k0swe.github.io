  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This year’s ARRL Rocky Mountain Division Convention was this past weekend in Albuquerque. The
original planners had backed out a couple of months before their event, so the Rocky Mountain Ham
New Mexico team quickly threw together a replacement event. I attended both because I had never been
to a division convention before, plus to be an extra hand to the RMHAM NM team.</p>

<p>There was meant to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array">Very Large Array</a> tour the
Friday before the event, but unfortunately that was cancelled due to a power outage. Instead, many
of the RMHAM Colorado folks and I travelled a short way to Los Alamos to experience the Bradbury
Museum and the Fuller Lodge.</p>

<p>After that, the event proper was underway.</p>
